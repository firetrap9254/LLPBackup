# LLPBackup
The Royal College of Anaesthetists' Life Long Learning Platform (LLP) has a portfolio backup function that doesn't work - you can use this as the starting point to backing up your assessments, documents and ARCP outcomes.

The script is written as a shell script, purely because it was written as a time saver / ugly hack for my own personal use. You're very welcome to port it to whatever language you fancy. I've tried to comment it out as fully as possible, but if you want anything clarifying then please don't hesitate to message.
